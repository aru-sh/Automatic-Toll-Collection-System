# Automatic-Toll-Collection-System
I developed an Automatic Toll Collection System. The hardware of the system consisted of Arduino Uno board with RFID sensor module which detects RFID of the incoming vehicle. The frontend of the system was developed in Java and the database used was MySQL. The system maintained vehicle number, vehicle type, account balance and automatically deducts toll tax based on vehicle type.
